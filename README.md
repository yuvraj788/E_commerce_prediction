# Understanding and Forecasting Customer Spending Patterns

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer spending behavior using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various features, the goal is to predict and understand spending patterns, which can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer transaction details with features like:

- Customer demographics
- Purchase history
- Seasonal trends
- Product categories

## Steps Involved

### Data Preprocessing:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Applying scaling techniques to normalize data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizing spending trends
- Correlation analysis
- Identifying outliers

### Modeling:
Implementing various regression models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **GridSearchCV with Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **GridSearchCV with XGBoost Regressor**

Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, RÂ², accuracy, etc.

### Results & Insights:
 E-Commerce customer dataset, Linear Regression is the best choice because it captures the linear relationships effectively, provides interpretability, avoids overfitting, and generalizes well on unseen data. ðŸš€
